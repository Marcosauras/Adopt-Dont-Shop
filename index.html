      <h2 class="font-bold text-lg">why Adopt don't shop</h2>
      <p  class="p-5">
        Adopt, Don't Shop is a campaign slogan that a growing number of animal
        rights proponents are using to promote adopting pets from shelters,
        rather than buying them from pet stores. Many of the animals sold in pet
        stores or online originate from puppy mills, commercial animal-breeding
        facilities that focus on increasing profit with little regard for the
        health and welfare of the animals. Although puppy mills in the U.S. are
        legal, a vast majority aren't regulated. Practices and conditions in
        most puppy mills are unethical and downright abhorrent in many cases.
        Dogs live in filthy conditions without adequate food, water, or
        veterinary care. And female dogs are bred at every opportunity with
        little to no recovery time between litters. Inbreeding is also a huge
        problem.

                    <h2 class="font-bold">You're Saving A Life</h2>
                    Adopting an animal from a shelter not only means that you're giving them
                    a happy life, but you also free up a spot at the rescue or shelter
                    to save another animal's life.

                    <h2 class="font-bold">You Can Find A Trained Animal</h2>
                    If you don't know much about training an animal or don't have the patience?
                    You can find an adult rescue animal who's already house trained and has
                    his basic manners down pat.

                    <h2 class="font-bold">Rescue Animals Are Often Less Expensive To Adopt</h2>
                    Rescue animals are much cheaper to adopt, having low adoption fees and
                    most of them have been spayed or neutered.

                <li class="pb-5 pl-5">
                    <h2 class="font-bold">Helps Fight Puppy Mills</h2>
                    Approximately 90% of puppies you can buy in pet stores or online are
                    from puppy mills. Adopting a dog from a shelter takes business away
                    from mills. The more people who adopt, the more puppy mills have a
                    hard time staying in business.
